### Tricks

Drag a wav/aif sound file onto a MIDI Track, and you will get a Simpler from this


### Simpler vs Sampler

Simpler vs Sampler (an overview)

The main difference is that Simpler uses one sample, and Sampler uses multiple samples.

Sampler doesn't have one shot or slice mode, operates with layers in ways that are more complex for sound-shaping.

Sampler does have various oscillators built into it as well as MIDI control for various devices, making it better for performance possibilities.

You can convert Simpler to Sampler by right-clicking on the title bar and converting it that way. It will carry over various settings.

Sampler->Simpler can also be done, but you lose some of the qualities.

A more detailed look at Simpler, here, probably more than I need at this point.

### Working With Simpler

Can drag selection around.

Simpler can be used to make your own instrument from a wav/aiff sample. The helpful thing here is to really spend time shaping the sample, coming up with smooth fade ins/outs.

#### Classic Mode
You have some very simple ADSR controls here.

Has a built-in filter, though with EQ eight, I don't know why we'd want this. Could create an .adg to manage this. 

Loop mode is fun

ADSR has some transpose features built into it, so we can use Tuner and move this around within Simpler, so that we don't have to create another effect or anything else in the chain.

#### One Shot Mode

Good with percussive beats. There is a nice spot in the tutorial at about 6:05, where he isolates a percussive groove and works with this, pitch-shifting it to get a nice effect.


#### Slice Mode

Can take longer samples and slice them up into MIDI notes, etc.

I can't really see a use case for this, but good to know what's possible.


### Live Sets


#### Simpler_Template

Template file we can work from

#### Simpler_Snouty

Like a pigs snout, works with a data input and is weird.

#### Simpler_Wub

Works better with a higher note range, 56-88


#### Simpler_WubLFO

Uses the wub but applies the built-in LFO to volume. It sounds terrible 

#### Simpler_Slices

Slices up a sample into little MIDI playback options. The MIDI Twister Fighter is a good controller for this.

I could see this being a good performance tool.

Trigger vs. Gate, could imagine different people's words cut up in different ways.

We could do this for one of my simple monthly sketches.

### Questions

on the video here, you can go into slicing mode, he talks about it at 3:12

How to save as ADG?

Can't really get the fade controls working properly, though they once were.


### Working with Sampler

Cannot actually get it to "work", check out 5:50 on the video, without pressing arm recording.

Can map individual samples into notes, which has a more complex effect â€” I could see this with the data coming in, each one gets mapped to some sort of recording of a note, or a combination of sounds, creating a rich, complex soundscape, controlled by just one MIDI effect.


#### Sampler_Template

Many voices/tracks into one sample.

Has 3 different drum pads, overlapping note ranges


#### Sampler_Ahs

Glitching Ah sounds at different note ranges
