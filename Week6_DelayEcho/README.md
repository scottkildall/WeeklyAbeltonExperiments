# Week6_DelayEcho




### Concept



Difference between the two

Technically the same. Echo is more of a casual term that refers to a delay that has some character, like old tape echoes, or bucket brigade pedals.

Delay is anything that introduces a delay into the signal, like Ableton has a track delay where you can delay the sound by whatever amount of time you enter. Delay can also involve repeating the signal too.

### Echo Effect

#### Controls

**Delay Time** In beats, you can unlink them

**Can do sync or time** 

**Notes/Dotted/Triple/etc**, small teakers on timing

**Delay Offset** small adjustments

**Input Knob** how much gets sent to delay unit, this is pretty critical.

**D** button, this applies analog drive to it, especially if you push the input, will add some grit to it

**Polarity** Button, can have a small effect, worth experimenting with

**Feedback** how long to delay before zero

**Dry/Wet** pretty self-explanatory, more wet = more echo-y

**Filter** useful for filtering out the delayed signal, low or highpass, etc

**Reverb** is it applied after or before the signal? Feedback will keep delaying the feedback

**Stereo** Stereo Width of the delayed signal, 0% is mono. I don't 100% get this.

**Stereo/Ping Ping/Mid Size** These are all ways to change panning in your ears.

##### Modulation Tab

Has ways to modulate the signal, can go into the rabbit hole here

Env/Mix is best just to experiment with

##### Character Tab

Threshold will control what gets delayed
Ducking related to dry/wet settings, good for letting in vocals, etc.

Wobble morphs the pitch very slightly, kind of fun to play with.


### Delay

The 1/2/3/4 selections are divisions of 16ths, ie 1/16, 2/16 (1/8)

You can also go to ms, like with echo

Shorter ones feel more pronounced

Left/Right channel can be linked/unlinked, like the Echo effect.

Offset (%) will work with pan, a "wide" spread. Works best with Sync mode, there is a workaround to achieve this.

Feedback will give you more repetitions of the synth.

Dry/Wet is pretty straightforward, can use this to affect the repetitions.

Freeze will cause endless repetitions, this will freeze the feedback altogether. This could be a performance trick!

Filter is a simple bandpass, this can be used to filter the repetitions.

Filters whatever sound the delay generates, not the original sound.

Can also turn off the filter entirely.


#### Modulation

There is Rate, Filter and Time variables. Rate is how often the filter gets applied, filter is % of filter applied, time will squeeze it out in different ways

Time: will modulate the delay time, producing a detuned kind of vintage effect

Mostly play with it.

#### Mode

Repitch/Fade/Jump

quite important, repitch is the default, replicating an analog vibe.

Fade will crossfade the current time to the new time.
Jump just tries to go that time. Very glitchy, can't see how this is useful at all.


Ping Pong, as we have see before

### LiveSets

**EchoComplex**

Shows a MIDI Live Set with various echo effects, not especially organized

**DelaySimple**

Uses a theremin instrument with simple delay

**DelayBass**

Uses bass instrument with simple delay

#### When in chain

Often the delay/echo comes at the end, but it doesn't have to, usually that's a good idea though
