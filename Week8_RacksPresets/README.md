# Week8_RacksPresetsNavigation




### Concept


Racks and Presets — how to create a chain of instruments/effects, proper ordering of these, how to save them, what they are all about.

Presets: a setting for a specific instrument or audio effect

Treat presets as the unit itself, don't thuk about whiuch instrument it is, etc.


Gets into file management and navigation.

### File Management


### Saving a preset, close rack and press the save icon, that will auto-save it into the correct folder

### File Management

#### how to find thing, should we delete / archive unused ones?

#### Color

Can use color to mark them

### File Types

.ALP = Ableton Live Pacl
.ADG = Ableton Device Group — instrument or effcects or something else
.ADV files


### Searching

You have options to search by type.

### Default MIDI / Audio Tracks

Can right-click to make these. Could be useful for things like EQ Eight and Sidechain Compressors, Tuners, etc, the tools I use all the time.

### Filters

Can make your own settings, but color-coding will be the easiest way to sort through them.


### User->Presets

This is where you store your various instruments, etc.

Can Group them and then save them with the disk icon into your User Preset

You can also do this with VSTs.

The concept is that you have your go-to presets ready to go; make a smoother wookflow.


### Saving as Templates

Self-explanatory, save as Template and, then it's in your user library. 

### Default Preset

Right click on the on the preset, save as Default Preset. This means that the "stock" preset will have these settings.

### Find Similar

Don't forget hot swap on the drum kit! that's cool

And they have that in the instruments too

### File Types

I still don't understand all the different file types of Ableton.

#### .als — Ableton Live Set

This lives inside your file project. Can do version control this way, though I'd prefer GitHub for this.

Templates are also saved as these types

#### .alp — Ableton Live Pack

This is essentially like a compressed .zip file that let

Go into Files->Manage Project, can save here as .alp. There are also other goodies there, like linked media files, etc.


### .adg — device rack preset

Preset file — the entire rack

###. adv — device effect preset

Delays, for example

### .alc — MIDI clip

Midi notes and timing (I haven't played with this much...)

### .agr — groove file

Haven't played with this much

### .amxd — max for live device

(not using Max)

### Questions

I don't entirely get the search options.

Get overwhelmed by all the different instruments and sound effects — how to solve this?

You can delete samples you don't like in custom sample packs


Do I cull the instruments somehow? Or the samples? That seems tedious



### Other Instrument Types - maybe for another day?

#### Collision

#### CV Instrument/CV Triggers

#### Drift

#### Drum Rack vs Drum Sampler
