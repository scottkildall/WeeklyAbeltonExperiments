# Week6_EchoDelayReverb




### Concept



Difference between the two

Technically the same. Echo is more of a casual term that refers to a delay that has some character, like old tape echoes, or bucket brigade pedals.

Delay is anything that introduces a delay into the signal, like Ableton has a track delay where you can delay the sound by whatever amount of time you enter. Delay can also involve repeating the signal too.

### Echo Effect

#### Controls

**Delay Time** In beats, you can unlink them

**Can do sync or time** 

**Notes/Dotted/Triple/etc**, small teakers on timing

**Delay Offset** small adjustments

**Input Knob** how much gets sent to delay unit, this is pretty critical.

**D** button, this applies analog drive to it, especially if you push the input, will add some grit to it

**Polarity** Button, can have a small effect, worth experimenting with

**Feedback** how long to delay before zero

**Dry/Wet** pretty self-explanatory, more wet = more echo-y

**Filter** useful for filtering out the delayed signal, low or highpass, etc

**Reverb** is it applied after or before the signal? Feedback will keep delaying the feedback

**Stereo** Stereo Width of the delayed signal, 0% is mono. I don't 100% get this.

**Stereo/Ping Ping/Mid Size** These are all ways to change panning in your ears.

##### Modulation Tab

Has ways to modulate the signal, can go into the rabbit hole here

Env/Mix is best just to experiment with

##### Character Tab

Threshold will control what gets delayed
Ducking related to dry/wet settings, good for letting in vocals, etc.

Wobble morphs the pitch very slightly, kind of fun to play with.


### Delay

The 1/2/3/4 selections are divisions of 16ths, ie 1/16, 2/16 (1/8)

You can also go to ms, like with echo

Shorter ones feel more pronounced

Left/Right channel can be linked/unlinked, like the Echo effect.

Offset (%) will work with pan, a "wide" spread. Works best with Sync mode, there is a workaround to achieve this.

Feedback will give you more repetitions of the synth.

Dry/Wet is pretty straightforward, can use this to affect the repetitions.

Freeze will cause endless repetitions, this will freeze the feedback altogether. This could be a performance trick!

Filter is a simple bandpass, this can be used to filter the repetitions.

Filters whatever sound the delay generates, not the original sound.

Can also turn off the filter entirely.
